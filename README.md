# Numerical Analysis Programs
This repository contains a series of Python programs developed for the discipline of Numerical Analysis. These programs are designed to tackle various numerical problems encountered in computational mathematics. They cover a range of topics including root-finding algorithms, numerical integration, and conversion between number bases.
